Hey Welcome to a project i tried to do wich grabs the conection to a server and projects it into a discord chat as an auto-updated embed 
as usual is free for everyone to grab it make sure to have a node_modules folder as a .git 
is my first open project for anyone to use it 
so i hope someone likes it.

a lot of thanks to pwall for helping me through everything on this bot showing me the best way to approach some questions about javascript
